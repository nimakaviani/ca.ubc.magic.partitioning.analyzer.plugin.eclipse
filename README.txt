06062012:

This is a new readme containing some thoughts and objectives. The plugin project current represents the
state of the art when it comes to the snapshot viewer plugin. Today I will begin work on the partitioner
in the hopes that getting the models to display correctly will provide a "wow" reaction (sort of, not
really). Then I will focus on connecting the two parts and gluing them together. I have also 
made note of the technical debt present in the snapshots portion of the project (in the form of TODO
statements).
